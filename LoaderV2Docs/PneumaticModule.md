# Pneumatic Module

{{BOM}}

The role of the pneumatic module is multi-fold: 

*   provide switched, high pressure (60-80 psig) nitrogen/air to the loader actuator in the robot
*	provide a series of streams of reduced pressure nitrogen to dispensing components: (15-20 psig to dispense bottles, 15-30 psig to electronic dispense regulator), including safety features like pressure relief valves
*	(in revision 2 and greater) house the electronic dispense regulator

It is worth noting that a number of configuration changes can be made in the pneumatic module to adapt the robot to locally available utilities; for instance, sometimes facilities have high-pressure filtered clean dry air available but nitrogen is only available at lower pressure.  In this case one can supply the actuator with air and the dispense system with nitrogen.

## Assemble the frame and main components {pagestep}

* 3D print the [AFL Pneumatic System Frame]{Qty: 1} if not already available.

* Mount the [FiveWayValve]{Qty: 1} to the designated position on the frame using [M4x10 screws]{Qty: 4} and a [No. 2 Phillips screwdriver]{Qty: 1, Cat: tool}. The valve should be oriented with the main port facing the input side of the frame.

* Install the two [AirRegulator]{Qty: 2} units to their designated positions on the frame using [M4x10 screws]{Qty: 4}. One regulator will be used for the actuator pressure (60-80 psig) and the other for the dispensing pressure (15-30 psig).

* Label each regulator clearly with its intended pressure range to avoid confusion during operation.

## Install pneumatic connections {pagestep}

* Install [PushConnector14NPTto14Tube]{Qty: 8} fittings to the appropriate ports on the valve and regulators. Ensure all connections are tight to prevent leaks.

* Install [PushConnector14NPTto18Tube]{Qty: 4} fittings to the ports that will connect to the smaller tubing used for dispensing.

* Connect the main air/nitrogen input to the first regulator using [NylonTube14OD]{Qty: 1, Unit: ft, Qty_Value: 2}.

* Using [PushConnectTee14]{Qty: 1}, split the output from the first regulator to feed both the five-way valve and the second regulator.

* Connect the output from the five-way valve to the port that will lead to the actuator in the robot using [NylonTube14OD]{Qty: 1, Unit: ft, Qty_Value: 3}.

* Connect the output from the second regulator to the [PushConnectTee14]{Qty: 1} that will split the flow to the dispensing components using [NylonTube14OD]{Qty: 1, Unit: ft, Qty_Value: 2}.

* Run [ETFETube18OD]{Qty: 1, Unit: ft, Qty_Value: 5} from the appropriate push connectors to where they will connect to the dispensing components.

## Install electrical connections {pagestep}

* Mount the [RJ45 jack]{Qty: 1} to the designated position on the frame. This will be used to connect the pneumatic module to the electronics module.

* Wire the RJ45 jack to the control inputs of the five-way valve according to the wiring diagram (to be provided separately).

## Test the pneumatic system {pagestep}

* Before connecting to the robot, test the pneumatic system for leaks by applying pressure and using soapy water to check all connections.

* Verify that the regulators can be adjusted to the required pressure ranges:
  * Actuator regulator: 60-80 psig
  * Dispensing regulator: 15-30 psig

* Test the operation of the five-way valve by applying control signals through the RJ45 connection.

* Ensure that all safety features, including pressure relief valves, are functioning correctly.

## Connect to the robot system {pagestep}

* Once testing is complete, the pneumatic module is ready to be connected to the robot system.

* Connect the actuator line to the in-robot module using the appropriate tubing and connectors.

* Connect the dispensing lines to their respective components.

* Connect the RJ45 cable from the pneumatic module to the electronics module to enable control of the pneumatic system.
