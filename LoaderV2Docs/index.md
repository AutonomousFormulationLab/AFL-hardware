# AFL Assembly Instructions/Notes

>!! A forward: these instructions assume some basic “scientific handyperson” skills: use of hand and power tools such as drills and screwdrivers, basic soldering, etc.  These tasks have different hazard profiles than many scientific/experimental activities, but are hazardous nonetheless, in fact far more people lose eyesight due to chips from drilling than from laboratory chemical spills.  Be vigilant and get help if you don’t know how to do something safely, follow your institution’s rules, and stay safe.

These instructions are structured in rough chronological order, but pages separate subsystems so you can somewhat mix/match things.

And you should definitely let people know about the [bill of materials]{BOM} page.
