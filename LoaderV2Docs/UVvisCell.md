# UV-vis Interface: A Simpler Example

## Overview
This guide covers the integration of the Autonomous Formulation Lab (AFL) with a UV-vis spectrometer, providing a relatively straightforward example of instrument interfacing.

## Components Required
- Flow-through UV-vis cuvette
- Tubing and connectors
- Mounting hardware
- Optional: temperature control components

## Hardware Setup

### 1. Flow Cell Selection
- Recommended flow cell types
- Compatibility considerations
- Path length selection guidance

### 2. Mounting and Positioning
- Optimal positioning relative to the AFL
- Secure mounting techniques
- Alignment considerations

### 3. Fluidic Connections
- Tubing selection (material, diameter)
- Connection to AFL pneumatic system
- Waste handling

### 4. Temperature Control (Optional)
- Integration with temperature control systems
- Monitoring options

## Software Integration

### 1. Communication Setup
- Spectrometer control options
- Data acquisition configuration

### 2. Automation Protocols
- Sample delivery sequences
- Washing/cleaning procedures
- Measurement timing

### 3. Data Handling
- Data storage formats
- Real-time analysis options
- Integration with AFL data system

## Validation and Testing

### 1. Flow Rate Calibration
- Determining optimal flow rates
- Ensuring complete cell filling

### 2. Sample Volume Optimization
- Minimum sample volume determination
- Dead volume considerations

### 3. Measurement Validation
- Comparison with manual measurements
- Reproducibility testing

## Example Applications

### 1. Concentration Measurements
